# News-web_crawling
The programme was original developed for automatically downloading online news from certain websites ([China Daily](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/), [Global Times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/), [Xinhua press](https://english.news.cn/)).   
Here I only upload core codes using requests & lxml.etree to get and parse obtained source codes of pages.  
The scripts were actually completed in 2020 and now the web layouts probably change much causing this programme to fail. However, I tested some web pages and some of them can still be parsed by the programme.  
I will adjust the web parsing synax in the future. 
----------------------------------------------
I fixed the parsing problem and now it can works on three websites. 
I plan to add more funcitons and downloading-available websites.
