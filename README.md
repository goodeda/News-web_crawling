# News-web_crawling
The programme was original developed for automatically downloading online news from certain websites (China Daily, Global Times and Xinhua press).   
Here I only upload core codes using lxml.etree to parse obtained source codes of pages.  
The scripts were actually completed in 2020 and now the web layouts probably change much causing this programme to fail. However, I tested some web pages and some of them can still be parsed by the programme.  
I will adjust the web parsing synax in the future.
